 Java : Java is  a  high level programming  
 -> Java is used to develop mobile apps, web apps, desktop apps, games and much more.
 -> it's secure , portab;le ,object oriented ,platform independent


 16th july 

 what is git?
  -> Installations of vs code .
  -> installation of jre and java 
  -> creation of github account
  -> git - used to trck the changes (changes are also called as commit)
  -> github - which is used to store the code 
  -> remote reposistory - github
  -> local reposistory - laptop 

17th july  

 -> installation of extension  pack for java
 -> JVM (java virtual machine )
 -> which is used to convert the bytecode  to machine level code
 -> It follows platform independent rule and portable in nature beacause it follows the wora function.

 ->JRE (java run time environment)
 -> which provides the run platfform the the bycode/javacode.

 ->JDK(java development kit)
 ->provides an application 
 ->contains the various tools.


1st program 

 public - Access modifier
 class - object
 static - no object is required
 void - no return type
 main - main method

 public class Hello 
 {
    Public static  void main(String args[])
    {
        System.out.println("Hello world");
    }
 }

-> JDK - write and run source code
-> JRE - complies the  bytecode
-> JVM - converts byte code to binary code

18th july 
 Running of same hello world program in different platforms to prove Java is a platform independent language 
 ->linux
 ->mac
 ->windows

 Variables : variables are the containers that is used to store the values in it 
 -> mainly variables follows the process of memory allocation
 -> it follows some set of rules such as the varaiable doesnot start with with digit it only starts with charater or underscore.
  ex: Student_id = 244; (which is true)
      3Student_id = 244;(which is false)

  Variables  ->digit
             ->letter
             ->underscore
             ->special digit

  In java we have 2 tpes of variables  
  -> instance variable (no initialization is required and which is return inside class)
  -> Local variable (declariation &  initialization is required and which is return main method)


Data types : Data types generally defines that which type of the variable we need to be stored.

-> primitive data type                                       -> Non primitive data type
 numeric                non numeric                          ->String         
 ->byte   - 1bit        -> char                              ->array
 ->short  - 2bit        -> Boolean                           ->interface
 ->int    - 4bit                                             ->enum
 ->long   - 8bit
 ->float  - 4bit
 ->double - 8bit
The above data type approach is called static type.

Arrays : two type single dimensional array .multi dimensional array .
 single dimension - only one axis ,element is used by index postition.index starts from 0.

 Syntax of array : datatype[] arrayname= new datatype[size];
